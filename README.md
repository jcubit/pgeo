`pgeo` is a projective geometry library project in $RP^3$. `pgeo` is inspired by the proposal of adding a linear algebra support to the standard C++ library (targeted for C++26) and implements a subset of the requirements. Since the focus here is $RP^3$ the matrix sizes are known at compile time and we can add different static matrix engines with the same Matrix API.
