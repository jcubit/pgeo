# pgeo
 
![logo_pgeo](logo_pgeo.png)

`pgeo` is a projective geometry library project in $RP^3$. `pgeo` is inspired by the [proposal](https://wg21.link/p1385) of adding a linear algebra support to the standard C++ library which is targeted for C++26. This library implements a subset of that proposal. Since the focus here is $RP^3$ the matrix sizes are known at compile time and we can add different static matrix engines with the same Matrix API.
